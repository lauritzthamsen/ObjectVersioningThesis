% Background
Programming systems such as the Lively Kernel allow to construct applications from objects.
Dedicated tools enable programmers to manipulate the state and behavior of objects at runtime.
Programmers are encouraged to make changes directly and receive immediate feedback on their actions.

% Problem Statement
When programmers, however, make mistakes in such a programming system, they want to undo the effects their actions had on objects.
For this, programmers either have to edit objects manually or re-load parts of their applications.
Changes are also often spread across many objects.
Recovering object states is, therefore, often error-prone and time consuming.

% Approach
This thesis presents an approach to object versioning for systems like the Lively Kernel.
Access to previous versions of objects is preserved using alternative, version-aware references.
These references dynamically choose versions of objects and, thereby, re-establish preserved states of the system. 

% Results
We present a design based on proxies and an implementation for the Lively Kernel.
An evaluation shows that the Lively Kernel can run with these proxy-based version-aware references and that preserved states of system can be effectively re-established.
The memory overhead of the version-aware references is reasonable.
Their execution overhead is, however, currently problematic.
% Conclusion
Yet, with faster proxies, the solution could be used to provide practical recovery support to programmers.
