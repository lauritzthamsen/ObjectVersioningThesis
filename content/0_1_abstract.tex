% Background
The Lively Kernel is a programming system that allows to construct applications from objects.
Dedicated tools allow programmers to manipulate the state and behavior of objects at runtime.
Programmers are encouraged to make changes directly and receive immediate feedback on their actions.

% Problem Statement
When programmers, however, make mistakes in such programming systems, the state of objects ends up differently than desired.
In such cases, programmers need to undo the effects their actions had on objects.
Recovering object states is often error-prone and time consuming.
Programmers either have to edit objects manually or re-load parts of their applications.

% Approach
This thesis presents an approach to object versioning for systems like the Lively Kernel.
Access to previous versions of objects is preserved using alternative, version-aware references.
These references dynamically choose versions of objects and, thereby, re-establish preserved states of the system. 

% Results
We present a design based on proxies and an implementation for the Lively Kernel.
An evaluation shows that the Lively Kernel can run with these proxy-based version-aware references and they allow to preserve and re-establish states of system.
The memory overhead of using these version-aware references is reasonable.
The execution overhead though is currently problematic.

% Conclusion
With faster proxies, however, the solution could be used to provide practical recovery support to programmers.
