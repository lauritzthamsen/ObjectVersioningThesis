\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:EVALUATION}

\subsection{correctness / completeness}

\begin{itemize}
    \item common JavaScript language benchmark suites
    \item starting and running the Lively Kernel with version-aware references, simple global undo / redo for lively
\end{itemize}



\subsection{feasibility}

memory overhead:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for the version-aware references for lively, measured (and explained… per proxy now...)
    \item something about how each new global version requires memory, but each depending on how big the changes are / or how much needs to be copied..
\end{itemize}


execution time overhead:
\begin{itemize}
    \item common JavaScript language benchmark suites – with vs. without proxies
    \item user interaction benchmarks – with vs. without proxies
\end{itemize}

maybe some discussion of the execution overhead and numbers on the different layers of the layered implementation cost how much performance: versioning proxy handler > default ES 6 shim proxies > harmony proxies in Chrome..
