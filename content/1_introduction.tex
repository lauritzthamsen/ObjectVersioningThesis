\section{Introduction} \label{sec:INTRODUCTION}

% Background
lively: background (self-supporting, web-based development environent). development of objects (direct manipulation of particular objects, halo buttons, object-specific behavior).

% Problem
problem: recovery needs (undo a change, lost changes, exploring the effects of changes/scripts without permanent changes).

% So what?

different approaches to recovering previous versions of state / undoing actions that turn out inappropriate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item command pattern to record and potentially undo recent actions, but need application-specific commands and undo implementations… unpractical considering the  recovery needs, because triggered scripts of objects can change everything else… side effects of operations might exceed a particular object.. difficult to implement rollbacks that cover everything..
    \item worlds, language construct for scoping side-effects, but explicit world sprouting, world selection, and commiting captured side-effects back.. similar to saving parts and worlds explicitly
    \item that is, we can anticipate recovery needs by saving intermediate versions, but have to do that explicitly and that takes some effort, so can be forgotten or doesn’t happen when we fail to expect an outcome and recovery need
\end{itemize}





% Solution
continuous versioning, as provided by CoExist, records all changes made to source code automatically and provides a fine-grained history of development states, allows programmers to concentrate on implementing ideas instead of also explicitly taking precautionary actions for potential and distant recovery needs..
but as implemented for Squeak/Smalltalk CoExist doesn’t recognize changes to object state…

we need continuous object versioning, behavior and state, similar to CoExist, recording versions of the system state whenever the developer or user triggers changes to the system by interacting with tools or an application, to be able to recover information from previous states…

approach based on alternative, version-aware references that know and choose from multiple versions for the same object
