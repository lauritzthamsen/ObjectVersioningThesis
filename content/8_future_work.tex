\chapter{Future Work} \label{chapter:FUTURE_WORK}

In the future, we want to improve the practicability of our implementation.
Speeding up the proxy-based version-aware references seems most important in this regard.
In addition, we would like to build upon our approach and implementation.
The system should preserve meaningful versions of the runtime automatically and support developers in finding relevant previous state in recovery situations.


\section{Improving the Performance of Our JavaScript Implementation}

Our current implementation makes JavaScript code execution significantly slower and the development tools in Lively considerably less responsiveness, as presented in Section~\todo{ref to 5.2 performance evaluation..}.

Our proxy-based version-aware references select dynamically to which version of an object any access should be delegated.
They also decide dynamically create new versions of an object, when it is changed after having been commited with a version.
Until then, for all reads, our version-aware references delegate to the latest, unchanged version for that object.
With this implementation, creating a new or switching the current version of the runtime happens incrementally instead of in a stop-the-world approach.
At the same time, however, this---the use of version-aware references--introduces a constant runtime overhead.
There will be overhead for incrementally copying objects on writes, when new versions of an object get created, but even for a single active version for the runtime and, thus, for each object, there is the constant overhead of resolving the version-aware references to their current targets.
Thus, when we want to speed-up the execution of JavaScript code and, thereby, also the responsiveness of Lively's tools, we need to reduce the time it takes to resolve a version-aware references, which in the current implementation is done by the proxies.

We use the Direct Proxies that the EcmaScript 6 standard will add to the JavaScript language.
As shown in Section~\todo{ref to 5.2 performance evaluation..}, our specific proxy behavior---delegate to a changing version of an essentially unrelated object---is currently only five times slower than the default behavior---delegate the access unchanged to the proxy's constant target; two orders of magnitude are introduced just by using proxies independent of any version-awareness.
At the time of writing the EcmaScript 6 specification is still only a draft.
We are able to use these proxies already because the Chrome browser implements an earlier, now deprecated specification of the proxies as an experimental feature and because there is a library that provides the currently specified proxies on top of the deprecated style of proxies.
However, given that the proxies are marked as experimental feature and also are currently partly implemented as JavaScript library---on language level instead by the virtual machine---on top of the deprecated variant, it seems reasonable to expect performance gains once the EcmaScript 6 gets finished and implemented by the browser vendors.
Another indicator that proxies could be faster is that equivalent indirections as provided with the proxy handler traps are significantly faster when they are provided manually through ordinary JavaScript functions, also as presented in Section~\todo{ref to 5.2 performance evaluation..}.
This suggests an implementation that is alternative to using the Direct Proxies.
We could still use objects as stand-ins for a multiplicity of versions, but implement the delegation behavior currently provided in proxy traps with ordinary JavaScript functions, which we could use consistently instead of direct object access through further source transformations.
Instead of, for example, \lstinline{anObject.aFunctionProperty()} the system would execute something similar to \lstinline{apply(anObject, get(anObject, aProperty))}.

Besides waiting for faster proxies or not using proxies at all, we could use proxies less deliberately.
Especially not for objects for which we wont have different versions anyways.
One example would be a parser implemented in JavaScript that creates lots of objects while parsing code such as currently used in Lively.
These objects are only necessary during parsing, which often only needs to return a success or a syntax error.
Additionally, given JavaScript single-threaded and cooperative execution in would not even be possible to switch the version during parsing with our current implementation.
So, in this parser example, there wont be multiple versions for any of the objects only created as intermediate results, rendering version-aware reference to such temporary objects irrelevant, while they still impede performance.


\section{Providing Continuous Object Versioning with Recovery Tools}

Our implementation allows to preserve and to re-establish versions of the Lively runtime, but these versions need to be currently created explicitly.
Developers still need to preserve particular versions, which is error-prone and effortful, as explained in Section \todo{refer to code exist section}. Developers might forget to preserve versions, or they underestimate the risk of changes and decide not to preserve a version.
At the same time, it takes effort to assess the risk of upcoming changes, to run appropriate tests to check the current state, and to commit a version.
For these reasons and as suggested by CoExist, we want the system to provide a fine-grained history continuously.
Developers should be able to recover versions that they have not explicitly preserved previously.
This includes that developers also need to be able to find the versions they are looking for.

We could conceivably create versions of the runtime for any change to an object.
However, while that might be technically feasible, developers also need to be able to find and recognize the particular versions they want to recover state from.
Therefore, we propose to preserve versions associated with actions of developers, to allow developers to undo the effects of their actions when they recognize actions did not only improve their programs.
In particular, the system could, for example, automatically preserve a version of the state whenever a developer
\begin{itemize}
    \item manipulates a graphical object directly with one of Lively's halo tools or through drag and drop, or
    \item directly evaluates (``Do-It'') a code snippet, or
    \item saves a script of an object or a method of a class, or
    \item triggers code execution by clicking a button or pressing a key.
\end{itemize}

Besides preserving versions continuously on a granularity helpful to the users, we also want to support developers in finding particular versions of the runtime by adding helpful information to each of the versions.
Versions can be presented in relation to each other in, for example, a timeline.
This way developers could see the order of their actions and for each version of the runtime, which versions preceded and which versions followed.
Such a timeline could also present timestamps for the versions.
Another helpful information would probably be the action that triggered preserving a version such as whether a developer used a halo button or evaluated a code snippet.
This could be supported by recording screenshots or even short screencasts for each version.
A third category of helpful information for a version, besides when and why a version was preserved, could be information on what was changed between two version: which objects have changed and how have they changed.
What source code changed can often be indicated by static information as, for example, a class, its module, and the containing package.
There is, however, less static information for objects.
In case of Livey, for graphical objects, we might be able to present how they relate to the scenegraph of visible objects.
Further, some objects do have explicit names in Lively.
How objects changed between versions can be presented in a diff view for both state and behavior.
Lastly, the system could also provide information on the impact of changes: For each version, we could also preserve results for test cases and benchmarks.

When developers have recovery needs and also find the particular previous version they were looking for, they might want to revisit it for different purposes.
For example, developers might just want to re-establish a particular state of the system to see how an application behaved or looked at that moment.
Similarly, they might want, for example, to try an alternative idea without loosing all versions following the one they are currently revisiting.
That is, they might want to create a branch of changes as an alternative to the main line of versions.
Further, besides moving freely between versions of the runtime as well as creating and deleting lines of history, they also probably will want to recover particular state from particular versions.
Such state could be a particular version of a graphical application part they are working on, but also could be the state of a tool such as a code browser currently opened on a specific source code module.
For this, we want to support developers in copying particular state up to whole objects from one version of the runtime to another.

All in all, this tool support for recovery should allow developers to find and re-establish versions, to create and delete lines of histories, and to diff and merge changes from one version of the system to another.

\todo{a specific interesting tool would be one that could be used to compare two versions of the state / two states, to not only see differences between two arbitrary states but more importantly to understand the impact/side effects of particular operations.. if i execute this script, what happens (especially besides visible side-effects..)}
