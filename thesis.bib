  Abstract = {Seaside is a Web development framework implemented in Smalltalk. It allows the easy creation of powerful Web applications using high level abstractions on the application components and on the underlying hypertext transfer protocol. In doing so, it builds upon the strengths of the Smalltalk object-oriented programming language and transcends many of the common practices needed in other, less dynamic languages. This book explains the major concepts of Seaside in a clear and intuitive style. A working example of a ToDo List application is developed to illustrate the framework's important concepts that build upon each other in an orderly progression. Besides the notions of users, tasks, components, forms and deployment, additional topics such as persistence, Ajax and Magritte are also discussed.},
